    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <P>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are languages that describe how the markup language is actually displayed
    [1], HTML, and XHTML, and are also available in XML. It is the standard for W3C and has a high degree
    of freedom in defining layout and style. If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for 
    the body of a website, the CSS is responsible for decorating like clothes and accessories.

    In other words, changing the CSS file without the HTML structure can make it look like a completely
    different website. For the CSS3 currently under development, features such as shadow effects, gradations,
    and variations can be added to replace images produced by graphic editing programs. Additionally, various
    animation features have been added, replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
